ArrayList
The ArrayList class implements the List interface.
It uses a dynamic array to store the duplicate element of different data types.
The ArrayList class maintains the insertion order and is non-synchronized.
The elements stored in the ArrayList class can be randomly accessed.

LinkedList
LinkedList implements the Collection interface.
It uses a doubly linked list internally to store the elements.
It can store the duplicate elements.
It maintains the insertion order and is not synchronized.
In LinkedList, the manipulation is fast because no shifting is required.

Vector

Same as ArrayList

Stack
The stack is the subclass of Vector.
It implements the last-in-first-out data structure, i.e., Stack.
The stack contains all of the methods of Vector class and also provides
its methods like boolean push(), boolean peek(), boolean push(object o), which defines its properties.
